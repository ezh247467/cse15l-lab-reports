![Image](Screenshots/InstallVSC)
* ### First start off by going to the [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* ### Then, as you can see from the image above, press the Download button. (It should automatically give you the download button for the Operating System you are using)
* ### Once the download is complete, go ahead and open the file to install the VSCode application.
* ### Once the installation is complete, you can now freely open the VSCode application. You should see something similar to the image below.

## 2. Remotely Connecting to SSH
*Disclaimer: I have only done the rest of this lab on MacOS, so I will only be going over the steps for MacOS.*

* ### As a student of UCSD, you will first need to go [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to find your course-specific account for CSE15L. 
* ### Once you have found out your course-specific account, open a terminal in VSCode and type in ```ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` where the ```zz``` will be subsituted with the letters of your course-specific account.
